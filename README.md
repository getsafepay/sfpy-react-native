# @sfpy/react-native

A React Native library for Safepay integration that provides components, hooks, and types to help you quickly integrate Safepay functionality into your React Native projects.

## Installation

Once the package is published on npm, simply run:

```sh
npm install @sfpy/react-native
# or
yarn add @sfpy/react-native
```

## Usage

In your React Native project, import the components and hooks as named exports:

```javascript
import { SafepayPayerAuthentication, SafepayContext, EnrollmentAuthenticationStatus, Cardinal3dsSuccessData, Cardinal3dsFailureData, AuthorizationResponse, PayerAuthEnrollmentFailureError } from "@sfpy/react-native";
```

## Example usage

Use the SafepayPayerAuthentication in the following way using the SafepayContext.

```typescript
export default function Index() {
    const values = {
        // this can be either a Time Based Token or JWT
        clientSecret: "0wX...A==",
        // this is the payment tracker token
        tracker: "track_c22f4888-dd09-4b99-83ec-e65dd9fc7b88",
        // these are the JWT and URL for Cardinal, provided by the payment API
        deviceDataCollectionJWT: "eys...f84",
        deviceDataCollectionURL: "https://centinelapistag.cardinalcommerce.com/V1/Cruise/Collect",
        // this is the address of the customer (this is optional)
        street_1: "St 12",
        street_2: "",
        city: "Islamabad",
        state: "",
        postal_code: "44000",
        country: "PK"
    } as SafepayContextType;

    return (
        <SafepayContext.Provider value={values}>
            <SafepayPayerAuthentication
                environment={ENVIRONMENT.DEVELOPMENT}
                onCardinalSuccess={(data: Cardinal3dsSuccessData) => console.log("onCardinalSuccess", data)}
                onCardinalError={(error: Cardinal3dsFailureData) => console.log("onCardinalError", error)}
                onPayerAuthEnrollmentRequired={() => console.log("onPayerAuthEnrollmentRequired")}
                onPayerAuthEnrollmentFrictionless={(data: AuthorizationResponse) => console.log("onPayerAuthEnrollmentFrictionless", data)}
                onPayerAuthEnrollmentFailure={(error: PayerAuthEnrollmentFailureError) => console.log("onPayerAuthEnrollmentFailure", error)}
                onSafepayError={(data) => console.log("onSafepayError", data)}
                doCaptureOnAuthorization
                doCardOnFile
            />
        </SafepayContext.Provider>
    );
};
```
